// At the annual family gathering, the family likes to find the oldest living family memberâ€™s age and the youngest family memberâ€™s age and calculate the difference between them.

// You will be given an array of all the family members' ages, in any order. The ages will be given in whole numbers, so a baby of 5 months, will have an ascribed â€˜ageâ€™ of 0. Return a new array with [youngest age, oldest age, difference between the youngest and oldest age].

function differenceInAges(ages) {
	let oldest = ages[0];
	let youngest = ages[ages.length - 1];
	ages.forEach(age => {
		age > oldest ? (oldest = age) : age < youngest ? (youngest = age) : null;
	});
	return [youngest, oldest, oldest - youngest];
}
